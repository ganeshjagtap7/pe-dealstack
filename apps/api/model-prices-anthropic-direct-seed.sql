-- ModelPrice seed: anthropic-DIRECT model ids.
--
-- The existing seed (usage-tracking-migration.sql) has the OpenRouter-style
-- 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5' (dotted, slash-prefixed), but the app runs
-- Anthropic DIRECT (chatProvider=anthropic, routedThroughOpenRouter=false) with
-- the hyphenated id 'claude-sonnet-4-5'. That exact string isn't in ModelPrice,
-- so recordUsageEvent logs "unknown model claude-sonnet-4-5, costUsd=0" and
-- usage cost is undercounted. This adds the direct ids.
--
-- Prices in USD per 1,000,000 tokens; mirror the Sonnet/Haiku tiers already
-- seeded for the OpenRouter variants. VERIFY against current Anthropic pricing
-- before relying on these for billing.
-- Idempotent (ON CONFLICT upsert) — safe to re-run.
