/**
 * Few-shot bank for financial extraction — period hygiene.
 * ========================================================
 *
 * These exemplars + rules target the defects the eval harness measures
 * (cohort-labels-as-periods, duplicate fiscal years, a future year split into
 * HISTORICAL+PROJECTED rows). Pass `buildPeriodHygieneGuidance()` as
 * `buildExtractionPrompt({ extraGuidance })` to inject them.
 *
 * Workflow (per the extraction roadmap): run the harness WITHOUT this block to
 * capture a baseline, run it WITH the block, keep the block only if the scored
 * metrics improve. It is intentionally NOT wired into production by default —
 * flipping it on is a one-line change at the classifier call sites once the
 * harness confirms the delta.

export const PERIOD_HYGIENE_RULES = `PERIOD HYGIENE — READ CAREFULLY (these are the most common extraction errors):
- A "period" is a fiscal REPORTING span only: a year (2024), fiscal year (FY2024), quarter (Q1 2024), month (Apr 2024), or LTM/TTM. Emit ONE row per distinct fiscal span.
- Enrollment / cohort / season labels ("Fall 2026", "Spring 2027", "Summer 2025", cohort or class names) are NOT periods. They are revenue CHANNELS/segments. Capture them as sub-line-items (e.g. "revenue_fall26_cohort") under the fiscal period they belong to — never as their own period row.
- Do NOT emit the same fiscal year twice. "FY2024" and "2024" are the SAME period — emit it once. If the document shows a year in several places, merge into one period row.
- A full year whose end date is AFTER today is a SINGLE PROJECTED period (e.g. "2026E", periodType PROJECTED). Do NOT also emit a HISTORICAL "2026" row for the same year.`;
