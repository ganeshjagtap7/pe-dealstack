Your task: find ALL financial statements in the document and return them as structured JSON.
${currencyHintLine}${dateContextLine}
STEP 0 — IDENTIFY CURRENCY:
Before extracting any financial data, determine the document currency:
- Look for symbols: $, €, £, ₹, ¥
- Look for text: "USD", "EUR", "GBP", "INR", "JPY", "dollars", "euros", "pounds", "rupees"
- If multiple currencies appear, use the one in the main financial statements
- Return the ISO 4217 code (e.g. "USD", "INR", "EUR")
- Default to "USD" only if genuinely no currency indicator found

STEP 1 — IDENTIFY UNITS:
Search the document for unit declarations:
- Header text: "in thousands", "in millions", "in billions", "$000s", "₹ Cr", "€M"
- Table headers: "(000s)", "(mn)", "(M)", "(B)", "(Cr)", "(Lakh)", "$M", "$K", "$B"
- Inline scale modifiers paired with the currency symbol: "$M", "$000s", "$K", "$B"
- Footnotes: "All figures in millions unless otherwise stated"
State your finding in the "unitsDetected" field.

CRITICAL — DEFAULT TO ACTUALS WHEN IN DOUBT:
- If the source has NO scale marker ($M, $000s, $K, $B, "in millions", "in thousands", "in billions", "(M)", "(B)", etc.), assume ACTUALS — store values exactly as written. Do NOT guess based on value magnitude.
- DO NOT use the SIZE of the number to decide a unit. A value like 22027 or 6700 looks "thousands-shaped" but is just as plausibly $22,027 (a small business's monthly revenue) or $6,700 (a YTD partial-period total). Trust the source. If it doesn't say a scale, use ACTUALS.
- DO NOT infer MILLIONS just because the company "looks like" it should be larger. Many real businesses (small SaaS, sole proprietors, partial-period totals) operate at low absolute dollar amounts.
- Disclaimer-text patterns that mean ACTUALS (NOT a scale modifier):
  · "All figures in USD" — no scale word, treat as ACTUALS
  · "in actual dollars"
  · "$ USD" used as a column header without an M/K/B suffix
  · "Amounts in dollars" without "thousands"/"millions"/"billions"
- Scale words MUST appear next to the currency or a unit indicator to count: "in millions", "in thousands", "$M", "$K", "$000s". The bare phrase "All figures in USD" is NOT a scale modifier — it only states the currency.
- For small businesses/startups, values under $100K are common — store them at face value, do NOT inflate.
- Set confidence to 70 max when units are inferred, not declared.
- When in doubt, assume ACTUAL dollars and tag unitScale "ACTUALS" — it is better to store $6,700 (with unitScale ACTUALS) than to silently inflate it to $6,700M.

SAME-VALUE-DIFFERENT-UNIT WORKED EXAMPLES (read these carefully — they show the trap):
- Sheet header says "(in $M)", value reads "2,500" → store 2500, unitScale MILLIONS (this represents $2.5B).
- Sheet header says "(in $000s)", value reads "2,500" → store 2500, unitScale THOUSANDS (this represents $2.5M).
- No scale header anywhere, footnote says "All figures in USD", value reads "2,500" → store 2500, unitScale ACTUALS (this represents exactly $2,500).
- No scale header anywhere, value reads "22,027" → store 22027, unitScale ACTUALS (this represents exactly $22,027 — do NOT promote to $22M).
- No scale header anywhere, value reads "6,700" → store 6700, unitScale ACTUALS (this represents exactly $6,700 — do NOT promote to $6.7M).
- Sheet labelled "Revenue ($M)", value reads "6.7" → store 6.7, unitScale MILLIONS (this represents $6.7M).
CRITICAL: WITHIN A SINGLE EXTRACTION, ALL STATEMENTS FROM THE SAME DOCUMENT MUST USE A CONSISTENT unitScale unless the source explicitly switches scales between tables. Do not tag one period MILLIONS and another ACTUALS based on the magnitude of individual numbers — that is a hallucination.

STEP 2 — EXTRACT:
1. Extract EVERY year/period column you find — do not skip any
2. PRESERVE THE SOURCE'S UNIT SCALE. Store values exactly as they appear in the document and set unitScale to whichever value matches the source: "MILLIONS", "THOUSANDS", "ACTUALS", or "BILLIONS". Do NOT convert values between scales.
3. Label each period: HISTORICAL (past actuals), PROJECTED (forecasts), or LTM (last twelve months). Use the DATE CONTEXT above to decide HISTORICAL vs PROJECTED — past relative to TODAY = HISTORICAL, future relative to TODAY = PROJECTED. Do NOT use your own knowledge cutoff.
4. PROJECTED is signalled by EITHER (a) explicit suffix: "E", "F", "Est", "Forecast", "Budget", "Proj"; OR (b) the period's end date is strictly after today. A period without an explicit suffix whose date is in the past must be HISTORICAL — even if the year (e.g. 2025, 2026) is more recent than your training data.
5. If a value is not present, use null — never guess
${sourceCitationRules}

CRITICAL — MONTHLY TIME-SERIES TABLES (e.g. P&L sheets with month columns):
When the source has columns labelled with MONTH names ("Apr-23", "May-23", ..., "Mar-26") — often grouped under year header rows — emit ONE PERIOD PER MONTH. The "period" field is the monthly label verbatim from the column header (e.g. "Apr-23", "May-23"). This is the ONLY correct interpretation — do NOT collapse months into annual aggregates, do NOT skip any month.

ANTI-PATTERNS for monthly time series (these are bugs we have actually shipped — do not repeat):
- ❌ Emitting one period per YEAR (e.g. period: "2024") with revenue summed from monthly columns. Wrong because it loses the monthly granularity that downstream MRR / TTM / 3-month-avg computations need.
- ❌ Emitting period: "2024" with revenue: 0 and source: "No annual total for 2024 provided; only monthly values present, annual total not found." This is a refusal to do the work — emit MONTHLY periods instead. Never emit a 0-value row for a year that has monthly data.
- ❌ Reading a "Total" column at the end of the row and assigning it to one of the year buckets. The grand-total column belongs to nothing — it is the sum across the entire history. Either skip it or emit it as a separate "TOTAL" period.
- ❌ Emitting 4 annual periods (one per year) when the source has 36 monthly columns. The correct output is 36 monthly periods, full stop.

WORKED EXAMPLE — monthly time-series source:
    Title    | 2023                            | 2024 | 2025 | 2026
             | Apr-23 | May-23 | Jun-23 | ...  | ...  | ...  | Mar-26
    Revenue  | 119.15 | 346.63 | 447.44 | ...  | ...  | ...  | 16,231.91
Emit (one period per month, ALL months):
    [
      { "period": "Apr-23", "periodType": "HISTORICAL", "lineItems": { "revenue": 119.15, ... } },
      { "period": "May-23", "periodType": "HISTORICAL", "lineItems": { "revenue": 346.63, ... } },
      ... // every month, all 36
      { "period": "Mar-26", "periodType": "HISTORICAL", "lineItems": { "revenue": 16231.91, ... } }
    ]

WORKED EXAMPLE — when revenue is split into channels (Stripe / Wix / Shopify rows):
Use the DYNAMIC SUB-CATEGORIES convention below (revenue_stripe, revenue_wix_website_speedy, etc.). Each monthly period carries the channel-tagged keys, and the rolled-up parent "revenue" is the sum of the channels for THAT month.

Each monthly period needs its own periodType. Months in the past = HISTORICAL. Months in the future (relative to today) = PROJECTED. The "as-of" date is whatever the latest filled month is.

If the source ALSO has explicit annual total rows / columns alongside the monthly grid, you may emit those as ADDITIONAL periods labelled "2023", "2024" etc. — but the monthly periods take priority, and the annual aggregates must agree with the sum of their constituent months (within rounding).

Use these line item keys exactly:
INCOME STATEMENT: ${LINE_ITEM_KEYS.INCOME_STATEMENT}
BALANCE SHEET: ${LINE_ITEM_KEYS.BALANCE_SHEET}
CASH FLOW: ${LINE_ITEM_KEYS.CASH_FLOW}

DYNAMIC SUB-CATEGORIES (when the source breaks a line item into named components):
Many sources break a single canonical line item ("R&D", "COGS", "OpEx", "CapEx", etc.) into source-specific sub-buckets — for example R&D split into "Engineering R&D / Product R&D / Applied R&D", or COGS split into "Cost of Goods" and "Cost of Services", or CapEx split into "Maintenance CapEx" and "Growth CapEx". Capture each sub-bucket as its own key using the convention:
    <parent_canonical_key>_<short_lowercase_label>
- The "<parent_canonical_key>" MUST be one of the canonical keys listed above (rd, cogs, sga, other_opex, total_opex, capex, ppe_net, accounts_receivable, inventory, etc.). Do NOT invent new parents.
- "<short_lowercase_label>" is a snake_case ASCII slug derived from the source's label (max ~24 chars). Strip the parent's name from the label if it appears redundantly (e.g. "Engineering R&D" under R&D becomes "engineering", not "engineering_rd").
- ALSO emit the rolled-up parent total under the parent's canonical key (e.g. "rd": 10) — children should sum to the parent within rounding. The frontend renders sub-categories indented under the parent.
- Skip the convention if the source does NOT break the parent down — only emit children when the source explicitly itemizes them.
- Sub-category values follow the same unit scale as the rest of the statement (do NOT mix scales).
- Confidence/_source citations apply to children too: emit "<parent>_<label>_source" alongside "<parent>_<label>" when source citations are required.

WORKED EXAMPLE — source page reads:
    R&D Expense                        FY2023
      Engineering R&D                    5.2
      Product R&D                        3.1
      Applied R&D                        1.7
      Total R&D                         10.0
Emit:
    "rd": 10.0,
    "rd_engineering": 5.2,
    "rd_product": 3.1,
    "rd_applied": 1.7
(Plus matching _source fields if source citations are on.)

WORKED EXAMPLE — source page reads:
    Cost of Goods Sold                  18.5
    Cost of Services                     6.2
    Total COGS                          24.7
Emit:
    "cogs": 24.7,
    "cogs_goods": 18.5,
    "cogs_services": 6.2

WORKED EXAMPLE — source page reads:
    Maintenance CapEx                    1.2
    Growth CapEx                         3.4
    Total CapEx                          4.6
Emit:
    "capex": 4.6,
    "capex_maintenance": 1.2,
    "capex_growth": 3.4

DO NOT emit children for line items already broken out as their own canonical keys (e.g. don't emit "total_opex_sga" because "sga" is already canonical). Only use the convention when the source's sub-buckets have NO canonical home.

UNIT SCALE — store values AS WRITTEN at the source's scale, then tag unitScale accordingly. Do NOT convert:
- HEADER SAYS "in millions" or "$M": value "50" → store 50, set unitScale "MILLIONS"
- HEADER SAYS "in thousands" or "$000s": value "1,500" → store 1500, set unitScale "THOUSANDS"
- HEADER SAYS "in billions" or "$B": value "1.5" → store 1.5, set unitScale "BILLIONS"
- ACTUAL DOLLARS (no unit header): value "$2,100" → store 2100, set unitScale "ACTUALS"
- EXPLICIT INLINE SUFFIX (e.g. "$50M" inside a table without a header): you MAY still preserve the suffix's scale. Prefer matching the dominant unit declared at the table header; if values within one statement use mixed inline suffixes, normalize to the table's declared header scale and only then store.
- INDIAN UNITS: report unitScale matching the source's declared unit ("Cr" → record values as written; if the table is in crore, document this in the "unitsDetected" field)
- Do NOT convert between currencies — only document the source's stated currency

STEP 3 — VERIFY YOUR MATH:
Before returning, check these relationships:
1. revenue - cogs = gross_profit (within 1%)
2. ebitda / revenue * 100 ≈ ebitda_margin_pct (within 1 percentage point)
3. ebitda - da = ebit (within 1%)
4. total_assets ≈ total_liabilities + total_equity (within 1%)
5. operating_cf - capex = fcf (within 1%)
If any check fails, re-examine your extraction and fix the error.
If the source document itself has inconsistent numbers, set confidence to 60-70 and add a warning.

Return JSON with this structure. unitScale MUST match the source — do NOT default to MILLIONS:
{
  "unitsDetected": "string describing units found",
  "statements": [
    {
      "statementType": "INCOME_STATEMENT | BALANCE_SHEET | CASH_FLOW",
      "unitScale": "MILLIONS | THOUSANDS | ACTUALS | BILLIONS",
      "currency": "USD",
      "periods": [
        {
          "period": "2023",
          "periodType": "HISTORICAL | PROJECTED | LTM",
          "confidence": 90,
          "lineItems": {

          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "overallConfidence": 88,
  "warnings": []
}
${sourceImportant}

If no financial data exists, return:

}
