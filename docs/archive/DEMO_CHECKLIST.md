## Demo Script (15-20 minutes)

### Opening (2 minutes)
**Say:**
> "Hi! Thanks for taking the time. I've been building an AI-powered CRM for Private Equity firms. It's still early stage - all the UI is done but no backend yet. I'd love to show you what we have and get your technical advice on architecture decisions."

---

### Page 1: Landing Page (2 minutes)
**Show:** index.html

**Talk Track:**
- "This is the marketing site - targeting mid-market PE firms"
- "Main value props: AI Deal Ingestion, Chat with Deals, CRM"
- "Design is intentionally institutional and professional"

**Don't spend too long here - it's just marketing**

---

### Page 2: Pricing (2 minutes)
**Show:** pricing.html

**Talk Track:**
- "Three tiers: Boutique ($249), Mid-Market ($599), Enterprise (custom)"
- "Monthly/annual toggle - saves 20%"
- "Feature comparison table at the bottom"

**Ask:**
> "Does this pricing model seem realistic for PE industry? I based it on Affinity and DealCloud pricing."

---

### Page 3: Dashboard (3 minutes)
**Show:** dashboard.html

**Talk Track:**
- "This is the analyst's daily command center"
- **Point out:**
  - Stats cards: Sourcing (18), Due Diligence (4), Closed ($42M)
  - AI Market Sentiment widget with 78% confidence
  - Active Priorities table with deals in progress
  - My Tasks checklist
  - Portfolio allocation chart

**Ask:**
> "What metrics should we prioritize here? What would PE analysts actually look at every morning?"

---

### Page 4: CRM (5 minutes)
**Show:** crm.html

**Talk Track:**
- "This is the deal warehouse - all opportunities live here"
- **Point out:**
  - Deal cards with financial metrics (IRR, MoM, EBITDA, Revenue)
  - **AI Thesis badges** - "This is auto-generated by GPT-4o after ingesting documents"
  - Stage badges (Due Diligence, Initial Review, etc.)
  - Processing card showing live document ingestion
  - Upload Documents card (drag & drop CIMs, teasers)

**Ask:**
> "Card view vs table view - which makes more sense for this data? Cards feel modern but tables are more data-dense."

**Technical Question:**
> "For the AI ingestion - we need to extract financial tables from PDFs and Excel. What's the best approach? I was thinking PDF.js + GPT-4o vision API, but I'm worried about accuracy."

---

### Page 5: Deal Intelligence (5 minutes)
**Show:** deal.html

**Talk Track:**
- "This is the deep dive view for a single deal"
- **Left panel:**
  - Deal header with stage and industry tags
  - Team info (lead partner, analyst)
  - KPI cards (revenue, EBITDA, valuation)
  - Deal progress timeline
  - Key risks and recent documents

- **Right panel - The AI Chat:**
  - "This is the RAG system - chat with deal documents"
  - User asks: "Summarize Q3 churn rate"
  - AI responds with citations (Page 14, Section 4.2)
  - Key findings highlighted in cards
  - File attachments shown

**Ask (MOST IMPORTANT):**
> "This is where I need the most advice:"
> 1. "Vector DB choice? Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, or just pgvector?"
> 2. "Chunking strategy for financial documents - they're very structured with tables"
> 3. "How do I handle citations? Users need to verify AI answers against source docs"
> 4. "Security - these deals are highly confidential. Encryption approach?"

---

### Wrap-Up (3 minutes)

**Transition to Architecture Discussion:**
> "So that's the UI. Now I need to build the backend and I'm facing some key decisions."

**Show PRESENTATION.md Section 6 (Questions for Senior Developer)**

**Prioritize These Questions:**

1. **Database Choice:**
   > "PostgreSQL with Prisma or MongoDB? Financial data is very structured, but documents are unstructured."

2. **Monorepo:**
   > "I'm using Turborepo - is that the right choice or should I use Nx?"

3. **AI Architecture:**
   > "For the RAG system - what's the best way to chunk 100+ page PDFs? Especially with financial tables."

4. **Real-time Updates:**
   > "Document processing takes 30-60 seconds. WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for live progress?"

5. **React Migration:**
   > "Should I convert these HTML pages to React now, or wait until I have backend working?"

6. **State Management:**
   > "Redux vs Zustand vs Jotai for managing deal data across components?"

---

## Key Points to Emphasize

### What's Done ✅
- 5 complete pages with full UI/UX
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Monorepo structure (Turborepo)
- Component library setup
- Design system established

### What's NOT Done ❌
- No backend (Express app is empty)
- No database (no Prisma schema yet)
- No authentication
- No AI integration (GPT-4o, embeddings, RAG)
- No file upload/storage
- Static data only

### What We Need Advice On 🤔
- Architecture decisions (DB, vector store, etc.)
- AI implementation (RAG, document parsing)
- Security & compliance (SOC2, encryption)
- Performance optimization (slow AI processing)
- Product priorities (what to build first)

---

## Fallback Questions (If Conversation Stalls)

1. "What would you do differently if you were starting this project?"
2. "What's the biggest risk I'm not seeing?"
3. "Should I build custom components or use a library like Shadcn?"
4. "How would you handle multi-tenancy for competing PE firms?"
5. "What's a reasonable timeline for Phase 1? Am I underestimating?"

---

---

## Technical Terms to Explain (If Needed)

- **CIM:** Confidential Information Memorandum - the deal pitch deck
- **Teaser:** Short 1-2 page deal summary
- **Due Diligence:** Investigation phase before investment
- **IRR:** Internal Rate of Return (performance metric)
- **MoM:** Multiple on Money (return multiple)
- **EBITDA:** Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization
- **LOI:** Letter of Intent (formal offer)
- **RAG:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (AI technique)
- **Vector DB:** Database for storing embeddings (semantic search)

---

## Confidence Builders

**If they ask: "Have you talked to real PE firms?"**
> "Not yet - I wanted to validate the tech architecture first before doing customer discovery. But I've researched Affinity, DealCloud, and Sourcescrub to understand the market."

**If they ask: "Why not use an existing CRM?"**
> "Existing CRMs don't have AI document understanding. PE analysts spend 2-3 hours per deal reading 100+ page documents. Our AI does that in 2 minutes."

**If they critique something:**
> "That's exactly the feedback I need. What would you suggest instead?"
