## 1. Readiness Audit

### READY (ship as-is)

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Deal Pipeline (Kanban) | Ready | Full CRUD, drag-drop, stage management |
| AI Financial Extraction | Ready | 3-layer extraction + self-correction, the core wedge |
| 13 Analysis Modules | Ready | Auto-generated from extracted financials |
| Virtual Data Room | Ready | Upload, folders, smart filters, sharing, insights |
| Investment Memo Builder | Ready | Templates, AI section generation, chat per section |
| Contact CRM | Ready | Import/export, relationship scoring, AI enrichment |
| AI Deal Chat | Ready | 6 tools, document search, financial queries |
| Multi-Tenant Isolation | Ready | 33 endpoints secured, 34 automated tests |
| Auth Flow | Ready | Signup, login, email verify, password reset, team invites |
| Rate Limiting | Ready | 3 tiers: general, AI, write endpoints |
| Error Tracking | Ready | Sentry configured (needs DSN in production) |
| Legal Pages | Ready | Privacy policy + terms of service exist |
| Landing Page | Ready | Hero, features, CTAs |
| Pricing Page | Ready | 3 tiers with monthly/annual toggle |

### NEEDS WORK (fix before beta)

| Area | Issue | Effort | Priority |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| **No Billing/Payments** | Pricing page has no Stripe integration — CTAs don't collect payment | 2-3 days | P1 for paid beta, skip for free beta |
| **No Product Analytics** | Can't track what users actually do — no Mixpanel/PostHog/Plausible | 1 day | P1 — you're flying blind without this |
| **No Onboarding Flow** | After signup, user lands on empty dashboard with no guidance | 1-2 days | P1 — first impression makes or breaks beta |
| **No Feedback Widget** | No in-app way for beta users to report bugs or give feedback | 0.5 day | P1 — need structured feedback channel |
| **No Welcome Email** | Signup creates account but sends no welcome/getting-started email | 0.5 day | P2 — personal onboarding call covers this |
| **Sentry DSN Not Set** | Error tracking code exists but DSN env var may not be configured | 10 min | P1 — must catch crashes during beta |
| **API Key Rotation** | OpenAI, Gemini, Resend keys may still be dev keys | 30 min | P1 — dev keys have low rate limits |
| **Portfolio Page** | Shows "Coming Soon" — beta users will click it | 0 | P3 — acceptable for beta, set expectations |

### MISSING (not needed for beta, but note it)

| Area | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Stripe Billing | Beta can be free or invoice-based — no self-serve payment needed yet |
| SSO / SAML | Enterprise feature, not needed for beta with <15 users |
| Mobile App | PE workflows are desktop — not a beta blocker |
| Salesforce Integration | Nice-to-have, not a beta requirement |
| Custom Reporting | Build after you know what reports users actually want |

## 2. Pre-Beta Checklist

### Technical (Do These First)

- [ ] **Set up product analytics** — Add PostHog (free up to 1M events) or Mixpanel (free up to 20M). Track:
  - Signup completed
  - First deal created
  - First CIM uploaded
  - First extraction completed
  - First memo created
  - First team invite sent
  - Daily active users
  - Feature usage (which modules get opened)
- [ ] **Set Sentry DSN** in Vercel env vars — catch every error from day 1
- [ ] **Rotate API keys** — Fresh OpenAI + Gemini keys with proper rate limits for beta load
- [ ] **Set APP_URL** in Vercel env vars → `https://pe-dealstack.vercel.app` (for invitation links)
- [ ] **Set RESEND_API_KEY** + verify sending domain (or use manual invite links as fallback)
- [ ] **Test the full signup → first deal → CIM upload flow** end-to-end on production
- [ ] **Create a demo deal** with sample CIM data that new users can explore immediately
- [ ] **Set ALLOWED_ORIGINS** if using custom domain

### Product (Build These)

- [ ] **Build onboarding checklist widget** — After signup, show a persistent card:
  ```
  Getting Started with PE OS
  ☐ Create your first deal
  ☐ Upload a CIM or financial document
  ☐ Review AI-extracted financials
  ☐ Try "Chat with Deal"
  ☐ Invite a team member
  ```
- [ ] **Add empty states** — When deal list, contacts, or VDR is empty, show helpful CTAs instead of blank pages
- [ ] **Add feedback button** — Floating button or nav item → opens form (Google Form, Typeform, or Canny.io free tier)
- [ ] **Add "Beta" badge** — Small badge in header/sidebar so users know this is beta and set expectations
- [ ] **Prepare sample CIM PDF** — A demo CIM that showcases the extraction magic (anonymized)

### Content & Assets

- [ ] **Record demo video** (2 min Loom) — CIM upload → extraction → analysis → memo
- [ ] **Write help docs** for top 5 workflows (or make Loom walkthroughs):
  1. How to create a deal and upload documents
  2. How AI financial extraction works
  3. How to use "Chat with Deal"
  4. How to build an investment memo
  5. How to invite team members
- [ ] **Prepare beta welcome email** (template below)
- [ ] **Prepare beta feedback survey** (template below)
- [ ] **Create a private Slack channel or WhatsApp group** for beta users (direct line to you)

## 3. Beta User Selection

### Ideal Beta User Profile

| Criteria | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **Emerging PE manager** (Fund I-III, <$500M AUM) | Underserved by DealCloud, makes fast decisions, price-sensitive |
| **Associate or VP level** | Primary daily user of any deal management tool |
| **Actively evaluating deals** | Has real CIMs to upload — tests the wedge feature with real data |
| **Technically comfortable** | Won't get blocked by minor UX issues |
| **Willing to give feedback** | Will actually respond to surveys and join calls |
| **Small team (2-5)** | Tests team collaboration without overwhelming support |

### Where to Find Them

| Source | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| **Your personal network** | Best first 5 users — people who'll be honest with you |
| **SearchFunder.com** | Post: "Looking for 10 PE firms to beta test our AI deal management tool — free for 3 months" |
| **LinkedIn DMs** | Target associates/VPs at Fund I-II PE firms. Personalized message + demo video |
| **PE LinkedIn groups** | "Emerging Manager Resources", "Private Equity Professionals" |
| **AngelList / Wellfound** | PE-adjacent startup founders who've raised and manage portfolios |
| **Business school alumni networks** | MBA grads at PE shops — early adopter mentality |

### Beta Cohort Plan

| Cohort | Size | When | Purpose |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| **Alpha** (internal) | 3-5 people | Week 0 | Your team + close friends in PE. Find showstoppers. |
| **Beta Wave 1** | 5 firms | Week 1-2 | Core feedback loop. High-touch onboarding calls. |
| **Beta Wave 2** | 5-10 firms | Week 3-4 | Validate fixes from Wave 1. Lower-touch onboarding. |

## 6. Success Metrics

### North Star: "Would you pay for this?"

| Metric | Target (30 days) | How to Measure | Red Flag |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| **Activation Rate** | 80% complete first CIM extraction | Analytics + manual tracking | <50% — onboarding is broken |
| **Weekly Active Users** | 60% of beta users use it weekly | PostHog/Mixpanel | <30% — product isn't sticky |
| **CIMs Processed** | 3+ per active user | API logs (extraction endpoint hits) | <1 — extraction isn't reliable enough |
| **NPS Score** | 40+ (good for B2B beta) | Survey responses | <20 — major product issues |
| **Willingness to Pay** | 50%+ say "definitely" or "probably" | Survey Q7 | <30% — value prop isn't landing |
| **Extraction Accuracy** | 85%+ "perfect or mostly accurate" | Survey Q5 + support tickets | <70% — need extraction improvements |
| **Retention (Week 2→4)** | 70% still active in week 4 | Login tracking | <50% — novelty wore off, not habit-forming |

### PMF Signal (Sean Ellis Test)
Ask every beta user: **"How would you feel if you could no longer use PE OS?"**
- Very disappointed → PMF signal
- Somewhat disappointed → Getting close
- Not disappointed → Not there yet

**Target: 40%+ say "very disappointed"** = you have PMF.

## 7. Known Issues & Workarounds

Share this with beta users proactively (builds trust):

| Issue | Workaround | Fix Timeline |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Portfolio page says "Coming Soon" | Not available in beta — focus is on deal-level features | Post-beta |
| Invitation emails may not deliver | Use "Share Invite Link Manually" popup to copy the link directly | Free Resend plan limitation |
| Some complex CIM layouts may not extract perfectly | Use "Edit" button to manually correct extracted values. Chat us on Slack. | Continuous improvement |
| AI extraction costs ~$0.05-0.15 per document | No cost to beta users — included free during beta | N/A |
| No mobile app | Use desktop browser (Chrome recommended) | Not planned near-term |
| No Stripe billing | Beta is free. We'll reach out about paid plans before beta ends. | End of beta |

## 8. Communication Templates

### Beta Invitation Email

```
Subject: You're invited to beta test PE OS — AI-powered deal management

Hi [Name],

I'm building PE OS — an AI-powered CRM specifically for private equity deal management.
We're looking for 10 PE professionals to beta test it (free for 3 months).

What it does:
• Upload a CIM → AI extracts financials in 30 seconds (no more manual Excel work)
• 13 analysis modules auto-generated (QoE, ratios, red flags, EBITDA bridge...)
• Chat with your deals in natural language ("What's the revenue CAGR?")
• Built-in VDR, investment memo builder, and contact CRM

Here's a 2-minute demo: [LOOM LINK]

What I'd ask from you:
• Use it on 2-3 real deals over the next month
• Give honest feedback (15-min call every 2 weeks)
• Tell me what's broken and what's missing

Interested? Reply to this email and I'll set up your account today.

It's been 2 weeks since you started using PE OS. Quick questions:

You mentioned that [specific thing they said about PE OS].
Would you be comfortable if I used that as a testimonial on our website?
