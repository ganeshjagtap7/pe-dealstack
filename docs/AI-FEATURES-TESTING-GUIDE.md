## Test 1: AI Contact Enrichment

**Where:** Contacts page (`/contacts.html`)

### Steps:
1. Go to the **Contacts** page from the sidebar
2. Click on any contact card to open the detail panel (slides in from the right)
3. In the detail panel, look for the **"AI Enrich"** button — it has a sparkle icon and is near the top action buttons
4. Click **"AI Enrich"**
5. Wait 5-15 seconds (the button will show a spinning icon and say "Enriching...")

### What to expect:
- The button changes to "Enriching..." with a spinner while processing
- After completion, you should see enrichment results appear below the contact details
- Results may include: **job title, company info, industry, location, bio, areas of expertise, deal relevance score**
- A **confidence badge** shows how confident the AI is (green = high, amber = medium, red = low)
- If confidence is **70% or above** — data is auto-saved to the contact
- If confidence is **below 70%** — it's flagged for your review before saving

### What to check:
- [ ] Button shows loading state while processing
- [ ] Results appear after processing completes
- [ ] Confidence score is visible
- [ ] No error messages appear
- [ ] If you refresh the page and reopen the contact, enriched data persists (if confidence was high)

### If something goes wrong:
- **"Contact not found" error** — Make sure you have a contact selected (clicked on a card)
- **Spinning forever** — The AI request may have timed out. Wait 30 seconds, then try again
- **Network error** — Check if the API server is running (ask dev team)

## Test 2: AI Meeting Prep

**Where:** Deal page (`/deal.html?id=...`)

### Steps:
1. Go to any **Deal page** (click a deal from the pipeline or dashboard)

3. Scroll down in the dropdown — you'll see an **"AI Tools"** section header
4. Click **"Meeting Prep"** (has a calendar/note icon)
5. A full-screen modal opens with two optional fields:
   - **Meeting Topic** — e.g., "Q3 financial review", "Initial discussion", "Due diligence kickoff"
   - **Meeting Date** — pick a date or leave blank for "Today"
6. Click **"Generate Brief"**
7. Wait 10-20 seconds

### What to expect:
- A loading spinner shows while the AI generates the brief
- After completion, you'll see a structured brief with these sections:
  - **Headline** — one-line summary of the meeting context

  - **Contact Profile** — who you're meeting with (if a contact is linked)
  - **Key Talking Points** — bullet points of what to discuss
  - **Questions to Ask** — suggested questions for the meeting
  - **Risks to Address** — potential concerns to bring up
  - **Document Highlights** — relevant docs from the data room
  - **Suggested Agenda** — proposed meeting flow
- Each section is displayed in a clean card layout

### What to check:

- A loading animation appears in the widget
- After completion, you'll see **signal cards** — each one represents a risk or opportunity detected:
  - **Critical signals** — Red badge, high priority (e.g., leadership change, risk escalation)
  - **Warning signals** — Amber/yellow badge, medium priority (e.g., financial event, competitive threat)
  - **Info signals** — Blue badge, informational (e.g., growth opportunity, milestone approaching)
- Each signal card shows:

- [ ] Deal name is shown on each signal
- [ ] Description and suggested action are present
- [ ] Multiple deals are covered (not just one)
- [ ] No error messages

### Notes:
- You need at least a few active deals for meaningful signals

- Critical/warning signals are also saved as activities on the deal's activity feed

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Button does nothing when clicked | JavaScript error | Open browser console (F12 → Console tab) and share the red error with the dev team |
| "Failed to fetch" or network error | API server is down | Ask dev team to check if the API is running on port 3001 |
| "Contact not found" / "Deal not found" | Missing data | Make sure you have the contact/deal open before clicking the AI button |
| Spinning forever (> 60 seconds) | AI timeout | Refresh the page and try again. If it keeps happening, the AI provider (OpenAI) may be slow |
| "No LLM provider configured" | Missing API key | Ask dev team to check the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable |
| Empty or generic results | Not enough deal data | Add more info to the deal (financials, documents, contacts) and try again |
