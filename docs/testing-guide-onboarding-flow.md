**Result:** PASS / FAIL

---

### 7. Completion Screen -- Dynamic Findings

**Steps:**
- [ ] After completing all 3 tasks (or skipping Task 3), verify the completion screen appears
- [ ] Check if the screen shows enrichment findings (sectors, fund size, portfolio companies, person title)
- [ ] If the agent is still running, verify a "processing" or "researching" spinner is shown
- [ ] Wait for findings to appear (may take 15-25 seconds)
- [ ] Verify confetti animation plays on the screen

**Expected result:**
- [ ] Completion screen displays with a congratulatory message
- [ ] Dynamic findings from the firm research agent are shown (or a processing state)
- [ ] Findings match the actual firm's website data (sectors, fund size should be realistic)
- [ ] Confetti animation is visible

**Result:** PASS / FAIL

---

### 8. "Open Your Deal" Button Navigation

**Steps:**
- [ ] On the completion screen, click the "Open your deal" button (visible if a deal was uploaded in Task 2)

**Expected result:**
- [ ] Browser navigates to `/deal.html?id=<dealId>` for the deal that was just created
- [ ] The deal page loads with the uploaded document visible in the VDR
- [ ] If no deal was uploaded (sample deal path), the button still navigates to the correct deal

**Result:** PASS / FAIL

---

### 9. Skip Setup -- Goes to Dashboard

**Steps:**

- [ ] Dashboard loads normally without errors
- [ ] Onboarding is not shown again on subsequent visits (onboarding status is marked as skipped)

**Result:** PASS / FAIL

---

### 10. Returning User -- Does Not See Onboarding Again

**Steps:**
- [ ] Log in with an account that already completed onboarding
- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard.html`
- [ ] Try navigating directly to `/onboarding.html`

**Expected result:**
- [ ] Dashboard loads normally, no onboarding redirect
- [ ] If navigating directly to `/onboarding.html`, the user is redirected away (to dashboard) since onboarding is already complete
- [ ] The onboarding checklist widget may still appear in the sidebar (showing completed status)

**Result:** PASS / FAIL

---

### 11. Settings -- Onboarding Checklist Persists

**Steps:**
- [ ] After completing onboarding, navigate to Settings
- [ ] Look for the onboarding checklist or firm profile section in the sidebar or settings page
