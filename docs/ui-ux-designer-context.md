- Drop zone at bottom of each column (min 100px)

**5. Bulk Actions Bar** (slides in when deals selected)
```
[X] 3 deals selected    [Change Stage] [Export CSV] [Mark Passed] [Delete]
```
- Navy blue background, white text
- Appears with slide animation
- Stage change opens modal with 9 options
- Export generates CSV download

**6. Ingest Deal Data Modal** (triggered from "Ingest Deal Data" button in header)

AI-powered deal creation — upload a document and the AI extracts company info, financials, and creates a deal automatically.

- **Two modes:**
  - **Create New Deal** (default) — extracts from doc and creates a brand-new deal
  - **Update Existing Deal** — search + select an existing deal, then add new data from a doc
- **Three input methods:**
  - **File Upload tab:** Drag-and-drop zone, max 50MB. Accepts PDF, Word, Excel, Text, CSV
  - **Paste Text tab:** Large textarea for pasting a deal summary or CIM excerpt. Character counter shown
  - **Company URL tab:** Enter a website URL to scrape public company data
- **Optional context section** (collapsible): How was this sourced? (Proprietary, Broker, Inbound), Company name, Initial assessment
- **Extraction preview** after AI processes:
  - Shows extracted fields: Company Name, Industry, Revenue, EBITDA
  - Each field has a **confidence bar** (0-100%) — green >=80%, amber 50-79%, red <50%
  - Overall confidence badge
  - "Needs Review" badge if confidence is low
  - **AI Follow-Up Questions** section (generated asynchronously — the AI asks clarifying questions about the deal)
  - Actions: "View Deal" (navigate), "Add Another" (reset modal)
- **Why it matters:** This is the primary way deals enter the system. A PE analyst uploads a CIM PDF and gets a structured deal in seconds instead of manual data entry.

**7. Import Deals Modal** (triggered from "Import Deals" button)

Bulk import for firms migrating from spreadsheets or other CRMs.

- **Step 1 — Upload:** Drag-and-drop CSV/Excel or paste tabular data. Two tabs (Upload File vs Paste Data). Max 5MB, 500 deals per import.
- **Step 2 — AI Column Mapping:** GPT-4o analyzes source columns and suggests mappings to PE OS fields. Each mapping shows confidence score — green (>=80%) = auto-matched, amber (<80%) = needs review. Unmapped columns shown as "Custom Field" (orange badge) — stored in deal's `customFields` JSONB. User can override any mapping via dropdown.
- **Step 3 — Preview:** Table showing mapped data (max 50 rows). Valid/invalid row counts. Shows data transformations: `$5M` → 5, `15%` → 0.15, `3.5x` → 3.5. "Import N Deals" button.
- **Step 4 — Results:** Success/failure summary. Green check = "X deals imported successfully!" Shows: deals created, new companies auto-created, failed rows with reasons (e.g., "Row 12: Missing company name").
- **Why it matters:** Firms switching from Excel tracking can import their entire pipeline in one shot with AI mapping — no manual column matching.

## Deal Detail Page (referenced from Dashboard + Pipeline)

**URL:** `/deal.html?id={dealId}`
**Purpose:** Deep dive into a single deal — financials, AI analysis, chat, documents, team notes.

> This page is NOT in the designer's 3-page scope, but deals are the core object — understanding this page helps design the Dashboard and Pipeline cards that link here.

| **Valuation** | LBO screening (pass/fail), benchmark comparison vs. peer deals | Is this deal viable for a leveraged buyout? How does it compare? |

## Design Principles

1. **Banker aesthetic** — clean, professional, trustworthy. No playful colors or rounded designs.
2. **Data density** — PE professionals need to see a lot of information. Don't over-simplify.
3. **AI as assistant** — AI features use emerald (`#059669`) accent to distinguish from core UI. Never dominant.
4. **Whitespace matters** — generous padding inside cards, breathing room between sections.
5. **Consistency** — same button styles, badge patterns, shadow levels across all pages.
6. **Progressive disclosure** — show key info upfront, details on hover/click/expand.

---

## What Needs Improvement (Your Focus Areas)

These are areas where a fresh UI/UX eye would be most valuable:

1. **Visual consistency** — Some pages have slightly different card styles, badge sizes, spacing
2. **Information hierarchy** — Deal cards pack a lot of info; could benefit from better visual weight distribution
3. **Empty & loading states** — Some are basic text; could be more polished
4. **Mobile experience** — Responsive works but isn't optimized for mobile PE workflows
5. **Micro-interactions** — Hover states, transitions, feedback on actions could be more polished
6. **Color usage** — Stage badges, analysis badges, status indicators use many colors; could be more systematic
7. **VDR insights panel** — Layout and information architecture could be improved
8. **Dashboard widget system** — 12 optional widgets need a better customization UX
