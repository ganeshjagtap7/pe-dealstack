## Team Notes & Known Limitations

These are NOT bugs — do not report these:

1. **Contact Enrichment confidence caps** — If a contact only has a name (no email, no company), the confidence score will be capped at ~30%. This is by design to ensure honest scoring.

2. **Portfolio page is "Coming Soon"** — Clicking "Portfolio" in the sidebar goes to a "Coming Soon" page. This is expected.

3. **AI Market Sentiment widget on Dashboard** — This is currently hardcoded/static data. It will be removed or made dynamic in a future update. Not a priority for testing.

4. **Dashboard customization** — There is no way to toggle widgets on/off yet. This is a planned future feature.

5. **Memo Builder partial implementation** — Some features may show the UI but not connect to the backend. Document what works vs. what doesn't — this helps us prioritize what to finish.

6. **VDR Data Checklist** — Currently the VDR insights show missing documents, but a proper checklist for tracking received documents is a future enhancement.

7. **"AI can make mistakes"** disclaimer — This appears below the chat input on Deal Chat and Memo Chat. This is intentional.

8. **Deal Chat says "PE OS AI • GPT-4"** — Even though the backend may use GPT-4o, the label says GPT-4. This is cosmetic.
