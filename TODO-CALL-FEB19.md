## 🔴 P0 — Critical Bugs (Blocking / Breaking)

These are broken features that currently affect credibility with testers/clients.

### 1. Invite Team — Email Not Sending — ✅ DONE (config fix)
- **Status:** Code is fully implemented using Resend email service. Was blocked by missing `RESEND_API_KEY` env var.
- **Fix applied:** Added `RESEND_API_KEY` to `apps/api/.env` on Feb 23.
- **Remaining:**
  - [ ] Add `RESEND_API_KEY` to Render production env vars
  - [ ] Test end-to-end invite flow in production
- **Ref:** (00:14:10)

### 2. Deal Values — Wrong Units ($38.2M vs $38.2K) — ✅ DONE
- **Status:** Fully fixed. All values stored internally in millions. Frontend auto-formats to K/M/B based on magnitude. Edit modal has unit dropdown ($, $K, $M, $B). AI extractor auto-converts during ingestion.
- **Key files:** `deal.js:192-211` (formatCurrency), `deal.js:2165-2206` (unit conversion), `aiExtractor.ts:4-12`
- **Action:** No further work needed.
- **Ref:** (00:15:44), (00:16:25), (00:17:17)

### 3. Cannot Delete Files or Deals from Data Room — ✅ DONE
- **Status:** Fully implemented in commit `ebd4440` (Feb 23). Cascading deletion covers 11 child tables. UI available in deal detail page (menu → Delete Deal), CRM list (single + bulk delete), and data room (file + folder delete).
- **Key files:** `deals.ts:373-449`, `deal.html:224-228`, `deal.js:103-126`, `crm.html:1082-1143`, `documents.ts:485-535`, `folders.ts:207-272`
- **Action:** No further work needed.
- **Ref:** (00:17:17)

## 🟠 P1 — High Priority (Core Product Quality)

Per Aum's guidance: *"Priority should be making the core product outputs accurate and reliable before investing in AI-native input features."*

### 4. Ingest Deal Data — Should Update Existing Deals (Not Just Create New Ones) — ✅ DONE
- **Status:** Fully implemented. Modal now has "Create New Deal" / "Update Existing Deal" toggle. Deal picker with live search. Backend merges extracted data into existing deals (higher confidence wins).
- **What's done:**
  - [x] Mode toggle in Ingest modal: "Create New Deal" vs "Update Existing Deal"
  - [x] Searchable deal picker with live results (searches by name, shows industry + revenue)
  - [x] All 3 ingest paths support `dealId` param (file upload, paste text, URL scrape)
  - [x] Smart merge: updates financial fields only when new extraction has higher confidence or existing is null
  - [x] Merges risks/highlights (appends new unique items)
  - [x] Document always attached to deal's data room regardless of mode
  - [x] Activity log shows "Document Added" for updates vs "Deal Created" for new
  - [x] Extraction preview shows "Deal Updated" vs "Deal Created" dynamically
  - [x] Button labels update: "Extract & Create Deal" → "Extract & Update Deal"
- **Key files:** `deal-intake-modal.js` (mode toggle, deal picker, dealId passing), `ingest.ts` (mergeIntoExistingDeal helper, dealId support on all 3 endpoints)
- **Ref:** (00:23:23), (00:25:43)

### 5. AI Extraction — Reduce Hallucination in Financial Data — ✅ DONE
- **Status:** Fully implemented. Backend extracts with confidence + source quotes. Frontend now displays source quotes, shows "Not Found" for missing values, and lists review reasons.
- **What's done:**
  - [x] Confidence indicators per extracted field (backend + frontend bars)
  - [x] Financial validator catches nonsensical values
  - [x] "Needs Review" flag when confidence is low
  - [x] Source quotes displayed under each field in extraction preview (Feb 23)
  - [x] "Not Found" shown when value is null with 0 confidence (Feb 23)
  - [x] Review reasons listed with specific details (Feb 23)
- **Key files:** `deal-intake-modal.js:165-232` (preview HTML), `deal-intake-modal.js:538-575` (setIntakeField with source)
- **Ref:** (00:20:27), (00:21:27), (00:48:08), (00:51:03)

### 6. Custom Filters — ✅ DONE (was misdiagnosed)
- **Status:** Fully working in `crm.html` (the actual CRM page). Initial audit incorrectly checked `crm-dynamic.html` (an older file).
- **What's working:**
  - [x] Stage filter dropdown with all stages
  - [x] Industry filter (dynamically populated from actual deal data)
  - [x] Deal size range presets (Under $10M, $10-50M, $50-100M, Over $100M)
  - [x] Priority filter (Urgent/High/Medium/Low)
  - [x] Sort by 9 options (Recent, Size, IRR, Revenue, Priority, Name A-Z)
  - [x] Search with debounce across name, industry, thesis
  - [x] Clear All Filters button
  - [x] Backend Zod-validated query params with Supabase filtering
- **Remaining (nice-to-have):**
  - [ ] AI-powered natural language filter (e.g., "show me SaaS deals over $50M")
  - [ ] Persist saved/favorite filter combos per user
- **Ref:** (00:18:14)

### 7. AI Reports / Templates — ✅ DONE
- **Status:** Fully implemented. Templates integrate with memo builder. AI chat quality fixed. Dynamic prompt chips. Citation preview.
- **What's done:**
  - [x] Template CRUD API (create, update, delete, duplicate, sections)
  - [x] Templates page and JS script
  - [x] AI analyst chat persistence
  - [x] Fix template preview to open in-app modal (was `window.open()` popup)
  - [x] Fix AI chat quality degradation (duplicate message bug — user msg saved then re-fetched + re-appended)
  - [x] Integrate templates with memo builder (backend auto-populates sections from template, increments usageCount)
  - [x] "Use Template" button on templates page → navigates to memo builder with `?templateId=<id>`
  - [x] Dynamic deal-specific prompt chips (section-aware, deal-aware, replaces static chips)
  - [x] Citation/file preview (matches source to deal documents, opens fileUrl or shows toast)
- **Key files:** `memos.ts` (templateId in schema, SECTION_TYPE_MAP, chat dedup fix), `templates.html` (preview modal, Use Template btn), `templates.js` (in-app preview, useSelectedTemplate), `memo-builder.html` (dynamic chips container), `memo-builder.js` (templateId handling, renderPromptChips, showCitation)
- **Ref:** (00:18:14), (00:12:10), (00:31:40), (00:32:35)

### 8. Parakeet Chatbot — History Lost on Close — ✅ DONE
- **Status:** Chat history was being saved to DB all along, but a CSS class mismatch prevented the intro message from being removed when history loaded — making it look like history was lost. Fixed Feb 23.
- **What was done previously:**
  - [x] Chat history persistence in database (ChatMessage table per deal)
  - [x] API endpoints: send message, get history, clear history
  - [x] Context preservation (last 10 messages sent to AI)
  - [x] History loaded on page init via `loadChatHistory()`
- **What was fixed (Feb 23):**
  - [x] Fixed intro message removal (wrong CSS class selector `.ai-intro-message`)
  - [x] Removed hardcoded fake document names from intro ("Q3 Financial Model" etc.)
  - [x] Added "X previous messages" header when history loads
  - [x] Added "Clear Chat" button in chat header (calls DELETE /api/deals/:id/chat/history)
- **Key files:** `deal.html:464-493` (chat HTML), `deal.js:1412-1457` (loadChatHistory), `deal.js:1338-1368` (clear chat)
- **Ref:** (00:10:39), (00:11:26)
