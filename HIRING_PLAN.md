# Hiring — 3 Roles Open

We're building an AI-native SaaS product. The MVP is live. We need people who ship.

---

## Role 1: Full-Stack Developer

**Contract · 3-6 months · Remote · 40 hrs/week**

---

### What you'll do

- Ship production features end-to-end — database schema to API to frontend UI
- Build and harden RESTful APIs: Express, TypeScript, Zod validation, auth, rate limiting
- Write real PostgreSQL — joins, indexes, migrations, RLS. Not just ORM calls.
- Build responsive frontends with Vanilla JS + Tailwind CSS. DOM manipulation, event handling, dynamic rendering.
- Integrate third-party services — auth providers, storage, AI APIs, payments
- Write tests. Deploy. Monitor. Own it.
- Work async. No standups. Ship daily.

---

### Who this is for

You've built and deployed real products — not tutorials, not coursework. You can take a Figma screen and a database schema and turn it into a working feature by end of week. You don't need hand-holding.

You're strong in:

- **Node.js + Express + TypeScript** — you've built production APIs, not just hello-world servers
- **PostgreSQL** — you write queries, you think about indexes, you debug slow joins
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — you don't need React to build an interactive UI. You understand the DOM.
- **HTML + Tailwind CSS** — you make things look right without asking the designer 15 questions
- **Git** — clean history, meaningful commits, proper PRs

Bonus if you've worked with:

- Supabase (Auth, RLS, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions)
- Vite, Turborepo, or monorepo setups
- React + TypeScript
- OpenAI / LLM APIs
- Vitest, Playwright, or similar testing frameworks
- Docker, CI/CD, Sentry

---

### Not for you if

- You need a ticket in Jira before you can start working
- You've only built CRUD apps with tutorials
- You can't debug a production issue without someone walking you through it
- You need daily syncs to feel productive
- You're uncomfortable owning a module end-to-end

---

---

## Role 2: UI/UX Product Designer

**Freelance · 2-3 months · Remote · 20-30 hrs/week**

---

### What you'll do

- Audit what exists. Build a unified design system from scratch — colors, type scale, spacing, components. One Figma file that rules everything.
- Design core application screens: dashboards, data tables, detail views, forms, modals, settings panels
- Design onboarding flows, empty states, error states, loading states. The screens nobody thinks about until the product feels broken.
- Design data visualizations — KPI cards, charts, pipeline views, comparison tables. Make dense data scannable.
- Define interaction patterns — hover states, transitions, micro-animations, feedback loops
- Hand off to developers in a way they can actually build from. Annotated specs, component docs, export-ready assets. No "just look at the Figma."

---

### Who this is for

You live in Figma. Your portfolio has dashboards, admin panels, analytics tools — not just landing pages and mobile apps. You've designed for data-heavy products where information density is a feature, not a problem.

You're strong in:

- **Figma** — auto-layout, components, variants, design tokens, prototyping. Expert level.
- **Design systems** — you've built one from scratch. You understand tokens, naming, and why consistency matters at scale.
- **B2B / SaaS product design** — 3+ years designing applications where users spend hours, not minutes
- **Typography + color** — you make intentional choices and can explain every one
- **Responsive design** — desktop-first, but tablet and mobile aren't afterthoughts
- **Developer handoff** — you've worked with engineers. Your specs are buildable.

Bonus if you've designed:

- Fintech / financial dashboards
- Dark mode systems
- AI/ML product interfaces (chat UIs, confidence indicators, AI outputs)
- Complex data tables (sort, filter, pagination, inline editing)
- Micro-animations / motion design
- You know enough CSS/Tailwind to speak the developer's language

---

### Not for you if

- Your portfolio is mostly landing pages and branding
- You take 2 weeks to design one screen
- You throw a Figma link and disappear
- You've never worked directly with developers
- You think "pixel-perfect" is an overused term (it's not)

---

---

## Role 3: AI/Backend Engineer

**Part-time contract · 2-4 months · Remote · 15-20 hrs/week**

---

### What you'll do

- Optimize RAG pipelines — chunking strategies, embedding quality, retrieval accuracy. Handle tables, headers, nested sections — not just paragraphs.
- Build document processing pipelines — extract structured data from messy PDFs, Excel files, Word docs. Tables with merged cells, footnotes, multi-column layouts. The ugly stuff.
- Build LLM-powered features — summarization, data extraction, classification, scoring, Q&A, report generation
- Prompt engineering — not vibes-based. Systematic design, evaluation frameworks, A/B testing, structured outputs.
- Build agentic workflows — multi-step AI pipelines that research, validate, and synthesize from multiple sources
- Build data enrichment pipelines — auto-research from web sources, APIs, public databases
- Manage cost and performance — caching, model routing (GPT-4 for hard stuff, 3.5 for easy stuff), batch processing, token budgets

---

### Who this is for

You've shipped AI features in production — not just Jupyter notebooks and blog posts. You know that the hard part isn't calling the API, it's handling the 20% of documents that break your parser, the prompts that hallucinate on edge cases, and the token costs that blow up at scale.

You're strong in:

- **LLMs in production** — 2+ years building with OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or open-source models
- **RAG** — vector databases, embeddings, chunking, retrieval, re-ranking. You've built this, not just read about it.
- **Document processing** — PDF parsing, table extraction. LlamaParse, Unstructured.io, PyPDF, or similar.
- **Prompt engineering** — systematic, evaluated, not guess-and-check
- **Node.js/TypeScript or Python** — solid backend skills. API design, async processing, error handling.
- **PostgreSQL + pgvector** — embeddings in Postgres, similarity search, hybrid retrieval

Bonus if you've worked with:

- LangChain / LangGraph
- Multi-agent frameworks (CrewAI, AutoGen)
- Fine-tuning (LoRA, QLoRA)
- Supabase Edge Functions
- Streaming LLM responses (SSE, WebSocket)
- Financial documents (statements, reports, filings)
- LLM observability (LangSmith, Helicone)
- Web scraping for data enrichment

---

### Not for you if

- You've only used LLMs through ChatGPT, not through code
- You optimize for benchmarks but can't ship a working feature
- You need a clean dataset to start. Real data is messy. Deal with it.
- You can't explain why your prompt works, just that it does
- You think caching is someone else's problem

---

## How to apply

Email **[your-email@domain.com]** with:

1. Your name + which role
2. A link to your best work — GitHub, portfolio, Dribbble, a deployed product, whatever proves you can build
3. One paragraph on why this interests you
4. Availability — start date, hours/week, timezone

No resume formatting requirements. We care about what you've shipped.

---

## Interview process

**Same for all roles: max 3 steps, done in a week.**

1. **We review your work** (async) — your portfolio/GitHub does the talking
2. **One technical conversation** (30-45 min) — we discuss how you think, not just what you know
3. **Paid trial task** (2-6 hrs) — real work, not whiteboard puzzles

Decision within 48 hours. We don't ghost.
