## 1. Launch Readiness Check

### MVP Feature Audit — READY

| Feature | Status | Launch-Critical? |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Deal Pipeline (Kanban + table) | Live | Yes |
| Virtual Data Room (VDR) | Live | Yes |
| AI Financial Extraction (GPT-4o + Azure) | Live | Yes — **this is the wedge** |
| Contact CRM + Relationship Scores | Live | Nice-to-have |
| Investment Memo Builder | Live | Yes — high perceived value |
| AI Deal Chat (LangGraph agent) | Live | Demo differentiator |
| Multi-tenant Org Isolation | Live | Yes (enterprise-grade security) |
| Meeting Prep Agent | Live | Nice-to-have |
| Portfolio Monitoring | Coming Soon | No — launch without it |

**Verdict:** MVP is sufficient. The AI financial extraction + memo builder combo is the wedge — no competitor does automated CIM-to-financial-model extraction at this price point.

### TAM Sanity Check
- ~4,700 PE firms in the US (PitchBook data)
- ~2,100 M&A advisory firms
- ~3,200 VC firms with deal flow needs
- At $1,000/mo average = **$120M addressable at 1% penetration**
- You only need 10 firms at $1K/mo = $10K MRR. That's 0.1% of addressable market. Very achievable.

### Kill Risk
**Enterprise sales cycle length.** PE firms are slow buyers (2-6 months). Mitigation: target emerging managers (Fund I-III, <$500M AUM) who make decisions in days, not quarters. They're also the most underserved — DealCloud prices them out.

## 2. Pre-Launch: Weeks 1-3

### Target Audience — Where They Are

| Channel | Who's There | Activity Level |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **LinkedIn** | PE associates, VPs, MDs | High — daily scrollers |
| **r/privateequity** (6K members) | Junior PE, aspiring PE | Moderate |
| **r/financialcareers** (180K) | Broader finance | High |
| **Wall Street Oasis (WSO)** forums | Analysts to Partners | High, skeptical |
| **PE Twitter/X** (#privateequity, #dealflow) | GPs, LPs, advisors | Growing |
| **Axial Network** | Lower middle-market deal community | Niche but perfect |
| **SearchFunder.com** | Search fund / ETA community | Underserved, deal-flow hungry |

### Content Calendar (Pre-Launch)

Post these across LinkedIn + relevant subreddits:

1. **"How we automated CIM financial extraction with GPT-4o"** — Technical deep-dive showing before/after of manual Excel work vs. AI extraction. Post on LinkedIn + r/privateequity.

2. **"The real cost of DealCloud for a Fund I PE shop"** — Positioning piece. DealCloud is $50K+/year. You're 10x cheaper. Post on LinkedIn + SearchFunder.

3. **"Why PE firms still email Excel files in 2026"** — Pain-point content about VDR adoption. Gets engagement from people who live this frustration daily. LinkedIn.

4. **"I built an AI that reads CIMs and extracts financials in 30 seconds"** — Demo video (Loom, 2 min). Twitter/X thread + LinkedIn.

5. **"Investment memo templates used by top PE firms"** — Lead magnet. Gated PDF download on landing page. Share on WSO + LinkedIn.

### Waitlist: NO
Skip the waitlist. The product is live. Instead, offer a **14-day free trial** with white-glove onboarding (you personally set up their first deal). At this stage, your time per customer is your competitive advantage.

### Landing Page Must-Haves
Your `landingpage.html` needs these specific sections:
1. **Hero:** "AI-Powered Deal Management for PE" + 30-sec demo GIF showing CIM upload → financial extraction
2. **Pain → Solution:** 3 panels — (a) Manual CIM analysis takes hours → AI does it in 30 seconds, (b) Scattered deal data → unified pipeline, (c) $50K/yr CRM tools → PE OS at 10% of the cost
3. **Live Product Screenshots:** Deal pipeline, VDR, financial extraction results, memo builder
4. **Social Proof:** Even without customers — use "Built by PE professionals" + logos of tech stack (Supabase, OpenAI, etc.) + "Trusted by X deals processed"
5. **Pricing:** Transparent. Show 2 tiers. Don't hide pricing behind "Contact Sales."
6. **CTA:** "Start Free Trial — No Credit Card Required"

### Demo Strategy
- **Format:** 2-minute Loom video showing the "magic moment" — upload a real CIM PDF → watch AI extract financials → auto-populate memo
- **Where:** Embed on landing page, pin to LinkedIn profile, attach to every cold outreach
- **Do NOT** make a 15-minute product tour. Nobody watches those.

### Social Proof Before Customers
- Ask 3-5 PE professionals to beta test for 2 weeks → get testimonial quotes
- Post "X CIMs processed" counter on the landing page (even if it's your test data — it shows the product works)
- LinkedIn recommendations from beta users

---

## 3. Launch Day Plan

### Primary Channels (ranked by fit)

#### 1. LinkedIn (Highest Priority)
PE professionals live on LinkedIn. This is your #1 channel.

- **Launch post format:** Personal story + product. "After watching PE associates spend 6 hours per CIM on manual data entry, I built PE OS..."
- **Include:** Demo GIF, 3 bullet features, pricing, link
- **When:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 8:00 AM EST
- **Tag:** 5-10 PE professionals you know. Ask 20 people to comment in the first hour (algorithm boost)
- **Follow-up:** Comment on your own post with a detailed breakdown of one feature
- **DM campaign:** Personally message 50 PE contacts with a tailored one-liner + demo link

#### 2. Product Hunt
Good for credibility + backlinks, but PE buyers aren't browsing PH.

- **Best day:** Tuesday or Wednesday
- **Prep:** Get a hunter with 1K+ followers (check Hunterai.co)
- **Tagline:** "AI-powered CRM that reads your CIMs and builds investment memos"
- **Assets needed:** Logo, 5 product screenshots, maker comment explaining the story
- **Goal:** Top 5 of the day for the badge. Use it as social proof everywhere.

#### 3. Targeted Communities (SearchFunder + WSO)
- **SearchFunder.com:** Post in their tools/resources section. This community is actively looking for affordable deal management tools. Frame as "built for emerging managers."
- **Wall Street Oasis:** Post in PE forum. Be genuine, expect skepticism, answer every question. Don't shill — share the technical approach to financial extraction.
- **r/privateequity:** "Show-off Saturday" or similar thread. Link to the Loom demo. Keep it conversational.

**Skip Hacker News** — PE/finance tools don't resonate there. The audience is developer-focused, not your buyer.
